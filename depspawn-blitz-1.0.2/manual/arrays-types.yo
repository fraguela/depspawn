The tt(Array) class declares these public types:

startit()

it()    tt(T_numtype) is the element type stored in the array.  For example,
        the type tt(Array<double,2>::T_numtype) would be tt(double).

it()    tt(T_index) is a vector index into the array.  The class
        tt(TinyVector) is used for this purpose.

it()    tt(T_array) is the array type itself (tt(Array<T_numtype,N_rank>))

it()    tt(T_iterator) is an iterator type.  NB: this iterator is 
        not yet fully implemented, and is NOT STL compatible at the
        present time.

endit()
