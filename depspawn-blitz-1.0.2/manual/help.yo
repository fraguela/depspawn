You can report bugs (or things you suspect might

bzindex(contributing to Blitz++)

Blitz++ is in open development: anyone can contribute features and
code to the library.  If you are interested in helping out with
coding or porting, you should start by subscribing to the tt(blitz-dev)
mailing list.  

This list is also the appropriate place to send suggestions for
features; just send email to tt(blitz-dev@oonumerics.org).
We can't implement it if you don't suggest it.

Archives of this list are available from the Blitz++ web site.

bzsubsect(blitz-support)

bzindex(blitz-support list)

using the Blitz++ library.  Anyone can post questions; anyone
can answer.
