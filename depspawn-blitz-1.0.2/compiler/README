                      Blitz++ Compiler Feature Tests

                http://monet.uwaterloo.ca/blitz/compilers/

August 1997

This tar file (bzconfig.tar.gz) contains a set of small programs to
test your compiler's support of new C++ language features.  Some of
these features are necessary for the Blitz++ library; others aren't.

Run the script bzconfig by invoking bash (or sh) on it:
bash ./bzconfig

After asking a few questions about invoking your compiler, the script
will compile and run a series of small C++ programs.  The results of
the tests are written to a file config.h.

* If you have problems getting the script to work, try setting
  "verbose=1" or "set -x" at the beginning of the script file.

Thanks,
Todd
